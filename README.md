# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic Route Middleware Inconsistencies

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes and middleware.  In some cases, the middleware does not apply correctly, and the route matching seems inconsistent.

**Bug:**

The middleware is intended to protect a dynamic route, however under certain conditions it is bypassed, resulting in the protected page being publicly accessible.

**Reproduction:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the inconsistent behavior of middleware application.

**Expected behavior:**

The middleware should always be applied correctly, protecting the dynamic route as intended.

**Actual behavior:**

The middleware is sometimes bypassed, leading to the protected page being incorrectly accessible.

**Possible Causes:**

* Issues within the new App Router architecture's middleware handling.
* Potential interaction problems between dynamic route segments and middleware functions. 

**Note:** The exact conditions causing the inconsistency may vary depending on factors such as the dynamic route structure, and additional middleware configuration, and the timing of requests.
